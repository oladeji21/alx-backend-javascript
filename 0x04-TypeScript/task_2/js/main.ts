// The documentation that helped me solve each task is listed above each task as a comment called "Sources"

// testing any task can be done as a .js file and run with node
// example: node main.js
// .ts can be compiled locally into a .js file using the command `tsc main.ts`. This will create a main.js
// file in the same directory as the main.ts file. tsc is the TypeScript compiler. It takes in TypeScript
// code and spits out JavaScript code. run `npm install -g typescript` on the terminal before using tsc.


// TASK 5

// Create the DirectorInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:
// workFromHome() returning a string
// getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
// workDirectorTasks() returning a string

// Create the TeacherInterface interface with the 3 expected methods:
// workFromHome() returning a string
// getCoffeeBreak() returning a string
// workTeacherTasks() returning a string

// Create a class Director that will implement DirectorInterface
// workFromHome should return the string Working from home
// getToWork should return the string Getting a coffee break
// workDirectorTasks should return the string Getting to director tasks

// Create a class Teacher that will implement TeacherInterface
// workFromHome should return the string Cannot work from home
// getCoffeeBreak should return the string Cannot have a break
// workTeacherTasks should return the string Getting to work

// Create a function createEmployee with the following requirements:
// It can return either a Director or a Teacher instance
// It accepts 1 arguments:
// salary(either number or string)
// if salary is a number and less than 500 - It should return a new Teacher. Otherwise it should return a Director

// TASK 6

// Write a function isDirector:

// it accepts employee as an argument
// it will be used as a type predicate and if the employee is a director
// Write a function executeWork:

// it accepts employee as an argument
// if the employee is a Director, it will call workDirectorTasks

// TASK 7

// Write a String literal type named Subjects allowing a variable to have the value Math or History only. Write a function named teachClass:

// it takes todayClass as an argument
// it will return the string Teaching Math if todayClass is Math
// it will return the string Teaching History if todayClass is History
